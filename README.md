Interrupt-Driven Water Tank Automation System (STM32 – Embedded Systems) 
• Designed and implemented an automated water tank control system using an STM32 microcontroller. 
• Used interrupt-driven programming for real-time response to water-level sensors. 
• Automated pump operation to prevent overflow and dry-run conditions.
